<ol>
  <li>Physical Barrier</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Skin</li>
    <li>Mucosal lining</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Cellular Barrier</li>
  <ul>

    <li>Phagocytic Cell  </li>
    Macrophages
    <br>Monocytes
<br>    Neutrophils
    <li>Non Phagocytic Cell</li>
    NK Cells (Natural Killer Cells)
  </ul>
  <li>Physiological barrier</li>
  <ul>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Saliva in mouth</li>
<li>HCL in stomach</li>
ect.
</ul>
<li>Cytokine Barrier </li>
Virus infected cell secrete protein called INTERFERONS, which protect non infected cell from further viral infections.<br>
They are made up of 270 amino acids.<br>
It stimulates adjacent cells to produce TRANSLATION INHIBITING PROTIEN(T.I.P).
<br>It is species specific.<br>
It is an anti-viral protien.
